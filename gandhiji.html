        <u>INTRODUCTION</u>:<blockquote><i> Monhandas Karamchand Gandhi </i>was born in the small town of Porbandar, on the west coast
            of India,<i> on October 2 1869</i>. He belonged by birth to the Vaishya, or trading caste. His father died when he
            was 15 years old, and apart from that time, his mother became the greatest influence in his life. Her
            spiritual teacher was a Jain devotee. Among the Jains in India the central doctrine is the "sanctity of all
            life," or Ahimsa, which is often translated as "non-violence." This teaching remained paramount with Gandhi.

            In South Africa

            When 19, he came to London, qualified as a barrister (being "called" at the Inner Temple), and, returning to
            Bombay in 1892, set up a practice.

            In 1896 he went to the Transvaal to help a client in a legal suit. That visit changed the whole course of
            his life. Seeing the social and political disabilities of his fellow-countrymen in South Africa, he decided
            to stay and help them and soon he had become their political leader and adviser. Meanwhile a religious
            conflict was taking place in within him. He read Tolstoy and corresponded with him: the result was an
            experiment in the simple communal life conducted by a small band of enthusiasts whom he had gathered
            together. He became an ascetic of the most rigorous type, setting great store by fasting and every form of
            self-denial. To the end of his life he remained a devout Hindu, but declared if ever "untouchability" were
            made part of Hinduism he would cease to be a Hindu. Perhaps the greatest religious effort of his life was to
            break down "untouchability."

            He went on steadily preparing his followers in South Africa for the struggle which was to end the
            indignities under which they suffered. Three times he went to prison. Little by little, the Indians gained
            the respect of the Europeans in South Africa by the faith with which they obeyed their leader in his
            campaigns of passive resistance. The summer of 1914 brought victory for the cause, and in July of that year
            the Gandhi-Smuts Settlement was signed.

            When the war of 1914-18 broke out he came to Britain to organise an Indian ambulance corps (he had done
            ambulance work in both the Zulu campaign and the Boer War), but was taken so seriously ill the doctors sent
            him back to India. He founded a religious retreat on Tolstoyan lines near Ahmedabad, the Viceroy conferred
            on him the Kalsar-Hind Gold Medal for distinguished humanitarian work in South Africa, and, by general
            consent, he began to be called by the name Mahatma, which means literally "Great Soul".Non-Co-operation

            A series of events quickly following each other at the end of the war brought him back into political
            leadership. The first was the passing of the Rowlatt Act, the second the tragedy of the Punjab and Amritsar,
            the third was what was regarded in India as the betrayal of the Indian Moslems by the Treaty of Sevres. He
            launched a non-co-operation movement in September,1920, but the non-violence which he demanded from his
            followers was broken. Congress revolted against his authority and the government selected the moment for
            eliminating him from the political scene. He was arrested, brought to trial for promoting disaffection, and
            sentenced to six years imprisonment.

            On his return to politics he found himself a stranger in the existing atmosphere of disillusioned realism.
            He yielded the leadership to C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, and retired to hand-spinning and the editing of his
            weekly paper. He showed no desire to resume his old position as dictator, and for that reason his moral
            supremacy was recognised even by his political rivals. So when at the time of the Simon Commission the old
            Congress leaders found that the young men were heading for revolution they decided that the only remedy was
            to call him back.

            Round table conference

            Gandhi, on his return, demanded from the government more than Lord Irwin's promise of future Dominion status
            or Ramsay MacDonald's offer of a round-table Conference. Hence his illicit salt campaign and plans for mass
            non-violence, which resulted in his second imprisonment in May, 1930. Britain had well recognised that she
            could not afford to allow the Round-table Conference, then sitting, to be a fiasco, and the new idea of an
            All-India Federation and the principle of responsibility at the centre was adopted.

            There followed the historic negotiation between Lord Irwin and Gandhi in which - on March 4,1931- Gandhi
            agreed to urge Congress to take part in the second Round-table Conference. But it soon became apparent at
            the conference that Gandhi's idea of a settlement was radically different from those of the Moslems, the
            Princes, or the British Government, and the only hope was that he might consent to stand aside. His attitude
            was still ambiguous when he returned to India from London at the end of the conference, but the refusal of
            Lord Willingdon (who had succeeded Lord Irwin as Viceroy) to discuss measures for restoring order decided
            for him his line of action. Terms of imprisonment in which he embarked upon "fasts" followed. Political
            India had meanwhile begun to look to Jawaharial Nehru for a lead - and Gandhi left the centres of political
            activity to go on a long tour on behalf of the untouchables' cause.

            Thenceforward it seemed that his political influence was on the wane. But congress had to meet the situation
            created by the Government's determination to give India a new Constitution. The realists maintained that
            civil disobedience had failed, and that Congress must try the policy of capturing the Legislatures. Gandhi
            declared in favour of this; endeavouring at the same time to avoid driving revolutionaries and idealists out
            of the Congress camp. All his old prestige and popularity returned, and he achieved astonishing successes.

            On his own authority in April, 1934, he called off the civil disobedience campaign, and thus made it
            possible for the Indian Government again to recognise the Congress as a legal and constitutional
            organisation. At the same time he gave public approval the drift towards Parliamentarianism and, finally, in
            October, he succeeded in remodelling the constitution of Congress and directing its activities on more
            promising lines, creating on one side an organisation for the development of village life and industries,
            and on the other a Parliamentary board designed to organise electioneering and to control the action of
            Congress members in the Legislatures.
